# Chatbot for the TUM CS course "Learning Object Oriented Programming"

In my bachelors thesis I built an educational chatbot for the TUM CS course "Learning Object Oriented Programming" (LOOP) on MOOC that is offered to students at TUM as well as to students in Bavarian high schools. Currently it is in a testing phase with Bavarian teachers. 

## Hosting

The bot (LOOP-Bot) can be hosted using docker container behind a nginx reverse proxy on a server or can be hosted locally for development.

This verison is connected to a demo NLP model for you to test.
